class Hook(object):
    '''Base Hook to be inherited from. Hooks can be passed to
    :class:`HookedModelIterator` and will be called at fixed intervals.

    The inheriting class only needs to overwrite those methods below, which are
    of interest.

    In principle a hook can be used to do anything during its execution.
    It is intended to be used as an update mechanism for the standard fetches
    and feeds, passed to the session managed e.g. by a
    :class:`HookedModelIterator` and then working with the results of the
    run call to the session.

    Assuming there is one hook that is passed to a
    :class:`HookedModelIterator` its methods will be called in the following
    fashion:

    .. code-block:: python

        for epoch in epochs:
            hook.before_epoch(epoch)
            for i, batch in enumerate(batches):
                fetches, feeds = some_function(batch)
                hook.before_step(i, fetches, feeds)  # change fetches & feeds

                results = session.run(fetches, feed_dict=feeds)
