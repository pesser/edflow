Things you have to do but don't want to do when writing your ML script:

- writing the same training loops over and over again
- take great complications in logging your variables
- back up your code
- save your settings for every run
- make outputs during training readable 

With ``EDflow`` you don't have to do that anymore but instead concentrate on
your model alone.
