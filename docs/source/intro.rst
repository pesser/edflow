Intro
=====

**EDFlow** is a training engine that is meant to safe you time and code.
While taking snapshots of your code **EDFlow** helps you to manage data logging,
create batches from data and run evaluation.
All in all **EDFlow** runs all the repetitive tasks you usually cannot quite copy-and-paste.

It is relatively easy to translate your current non-EDFlow learning script into an EDFlow compatible one.
Although we do not have an auto-translation tool (yet), feel free to take look at our Tutorial_.
This also serves as a nice practical introduction to **EDFLow**.

Overall **EDFlow** allows you to recycle as much code as possible throughout your projects in the easiest possible way.
We hope you enjoy your future with **EDFlow** :\*.

Yours truly,
Mimo Tillbich
